Tasks 




- Deleting checklist items
    - having an empty checklist still creates a check list.  
      Need to include a check so that if the checklist is empty then the array is empty
      This will also need to be reflected in the edit form

- 


- General - (maybe insert a 'refresh display button' that refreshes the display)

- EditItem - the summary/full version is now removed, and only shows the form // Done
- EditItem - the way the form is displayed needs to be made consistent with the item display info. // working on this
- EditItem - this needs a function to get info from the form, once submitted
- EditItem - investiage changing category as well....need to populate the category too.
- EditItem - this needs the array to be updated.
- EditItem - then after, it needs to refresht the display.

- EditItem - need to activate addition of new checklist item when you press add new checklist item

- newItem - insert a checklist?
- need to insert provision for a checklist in the class....
    - a new array called checklist.

- EditItem - when editing an item do you disable all other items from being edited?
            - the reason why you might want this is because at the moment only one 'add checklist item'
            button is operational. If you have more edit items opened then only the first 'add checklist item' 
            button will be triggered.
                You could create a documentquerySelectorAll + 'forEach' to listen for all 'add checklist item' buttons
                That is triggered as soon as you press edit, so taht they are all encapsulated...
                    This would allow multiple items to be edited at the same time....which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing
                    And if you save the changes to the form they would all be tied back to the item.
                    In some respects this would be simpler than actively silencing all other edit buttons....
    
- Checklist
    - The checklist seems to be the same for each items instead of unique to each item.
    - This was revealed when you update an item, it updates the checklist the same way for all items.

- New Category New Item
    - Creating a new category does not disable the creation of a new item and vice versa.
    - You can easily cancel out of this so not sure that it matters that much



Done
- After you submit an item, the item toggle doesn't work so you need to call the event listener again.//
    - **It was b/c the event listener had been renamed but the named hadn't been changed when it was called.



- Create New Item 
    - After  you create a new Item, you need to relaunch the event listener to create another item.
    - It turns the event listener off while you are filling in an item but it should turn on again after it is submitted
    - **I'm not sure how I fixed this, but it may have been when I split the Form object into 'create' and 'retrieve', and got rid of another function call.
